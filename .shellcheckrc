# Mole project shellcheck configuration

# Keep the lint strict by default. Add rules to disable only when we have a
# clear justification.
#
# Examples:
# disable=SC2034  # unused variables (if intentionally unused)
# disable=SC1091  # sourcing files not present in repo (optional)

# Currently no global disables are required.
